Tunechi!
I ain't never scared and I ain't never horrified
I just look down at my Rolex, it said it's the darkest times
I ain't never terrified, I ain't never petrified
You know I see dead people, I just tell 'em, "Get a life!"
I ain't never scurred, I'm not sure if that's a word, but
I mean every word, feelin' like "do not disturb," wait,
Let me testify, I have never testified,
